!> \brief General purpose of the w90_in_siesta types module:
!! defines data structures to handle the specification
!!     of the Wannier90 transformation within SIESTA. 
!!
!! This specification
!! is read from the fdf file by routine 'read_w90_in_specs'.
!!
!! Here we define the derived type w90_in_manifold_t, where all the
!! relevant information for a manifold of bands is stored.
!!
!! Then, we also define some relevant information regarding the k-point
!! sampling, the atomic structure, and eventually,
!! the chemical potential that can be applied to a particular
!! Wannier function

      module w90_in_siesta_types
