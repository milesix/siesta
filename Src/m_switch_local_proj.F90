!> \brief General purpose of the switch_local_projection module:
!!
!! The interface between Siesta and WANNIER90 shares many similarities
!! with the Lowdin projection algorithm.
!! Here, depending on the kind of projection to localized orbitals 
!! that will be carried out,
!! the relevant matrices and arrays for the projections will be populated.
