This is the original FDF package, by Alberto Garcia and Jose Soler.

Please see the LICENSE file for conditions of use.

NOTES:

The library, as compiled, still depends on the functionality of an
"io" package. In Siesta, that is provided by file Src/io.f (which has
its own Siesta-specific dependencies). If you use fdf in your program,
you will need to link it to something similar to the code in
io_for_fdf_tests.f.
