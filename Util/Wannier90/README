Preparing Wannier90 for SIESTA calculations
===========================================


Motivations
-----------

Wannier90 is mostly meant to be used as a standalone program, reading its
parameters from input files and writing results to output files. In these
conditions, performing a wannierisation with SIESTA would mean prepare the
input data, interrupt the SIESTA calculation, run Wannier90 for each manifold
of interest, and then continue with the SIESTA calculation. Such a procedure
would invlove several manual steps, which would make it particularly
error-prone.

In order to streamline the whole process and have Wannier90 run embedded in
SIESTA, it is necessary to build a modified version of its source code. These
changes allow Wannier90 to receive its input directly from SIESTA and to be
run several times with different input parameters without having to stop the
program. They have been kept minimalistic, in order not to interfere with the
internals of Wannier90 and make it easier to keep SIESTA synchronised with the
evolution of the source code.


Building a modified Wannier90
-----------------------------

In this directory you will find the required patches for a specific Wannier90
version.

The next step is to download an official release tarball from the Wannier90
website:

  http://www.wannier.org/download/

The version to download must correspond exactly to the version of the patch
you want to apply. For instance, if the patch is called
"wannier90-3.0.0.patch", you have to download the 3.0.0 version of
Wannier90. Applying the patch to other versions will likely fail. We will use
this version as an example for the rest of these instructions.

Uncompress the source code of Wannier90 and go to its top directory, e.g.:

  tar xvzf wannier90-3.0.0.tar.gz
  cd wannier90-3.0.0

From there, you can apply the patch from SIESTA:

  patch -p1 < /path/to/siesta/Util/Wannier90/wannier90-3.0.0.patch

where you replace /path/to/siesta/Util/Wannier90 by the directory path
containing the patch file.

Once done, you can follow the instructions found in the README.install file of
Wannier90 to configure the build. You should then type "make lib" to build the
Wannier90 library, which is the only part of interest to SIESTA.
If SIESTA is compiled with MPI, so should Wannier90.


Using a modified Wannier90 from SIESTA
--------------------------------------

To use the Wannier90 library you just have built with SIESTA, start by
configuring your SIESTA object dir as instructed in the Obj/README file of the
SIESTA source code.

Then, make sure that your arch.make contains the following lines:


  WANNIER90_ROOT = /path/to/wannier90
  LIBS += -L$(WANNIER90_ROOT) -lwannier
  INCFLAGS += -I$(WANNIER90_ROOT)/src/obj
  FPPFLAGS += -DSIESTA__WANNIER90

where you replace /path/to/wannier90 by the full path to the top source
directory of Wannier90.

Once done, you can proceed as usual with the build of SIESTA.
