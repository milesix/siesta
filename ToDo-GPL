Decide on final name for package. Siesta3L seems adequate,
with '3' implying "old version" and 'L' meaning "Libre".
But we do not need to explain this.

Decide how to refer to the name 'SIESTA' which is
pervasive. There is an attempt in the INTRODUCTION section of the manual.
Thankfully we have the old dichotomy "method/implementation" to fall back on.

Update NOTICE.txt for other bundled software?
Decide what to do with ATOM

Insert a header in every file, in some cases
replacing the existing header. Do this off-bzr?

For removing the old one, use:
(you can search for Fundacion to identify the files:
     grep -lr Fundacion .
)

sed -i '.bak' '/part of the SIESTA package/,/all legitimate users/d' file

for in-place editing (and saving a backup in file.bak).

(this will work regardless of the prefix character)
