Minimal compilation and linking instruccions for use LIBXC in a Linres calculation
=========================================================================

1) Download and unpack the Libxc version 2.2.3 (up to now, the only checked) from: https://gitlab.com/libxc/libxc/tree/2.2.3

2) Install Libxc following the information provided by the authors. Basically:
    1-cd to the directory containing the package's source
    2- ./configure --prefix=/destination/folder/installation CC=c_compiler FC=fortran_compiler 
    3-  make, make check, make install 
(Read the LIBXC INSTALL file for further options and specific configuration)

3) The SIESTA arch.make contains several lines related to Libxc:
   ###ADD LIBXC STUFF
   #LIBXC_ROOT=points to your libxc installation path
   LIBXC_ROOT=
   LIBXC_INCFLAGS= -I $(LIBXC_ROOT)/include
   LIBXC_LIBS=-L$(LIBXC_ROOT)/lib -l xcf90 -l xc
   #LIBXC_INCFLAGS= 
   USE_LIBXC=1

4) Compile Siesta as usual with the correct definition of LIBXC_ROOT variable (pointing to the Libxc instalation folder that contains the bin, include and lib folders)

5) You can check whether the installation has been successful by running the Linres-Libxc test that you can find in the folder Tests.

HOW TO USE LIBXC IN A SIESTA (OR) LINRES CALCULATION
==================================================================================
Siesta can use ONLY all the LDA and GGA XC-potentials included in the LIBXC library
Linres uses LIBXC to obtain the second energy (EXC) derivatives (respect to density and density gradient) to compute the perturbed potential. Thus, Linres can use ONLY LDA and GGA XC-potentials.

Examples: define in the .fdf file blocks like this (in the most general form, EX and EC from different authors):

LDA example (LDA CA)

%block XC.hybrid
2
LDA LIBXC-01-LDA_X 1.0 0.0
LDA LIBXC-09-LDA_C_PZ 0.0 1.0
%endblock

GGA example (GGA PBE)

%block XC.hybrid
2
GGA LIBXC-00-GGA_X_PBE 1.0 0.0
GGA LIBXC-00-GGA_C_PBE 0.0 1.0
%endblock

General form to call the XC-potential:

Flavour LIBXC-xc_ide-NAME EX_weight EC_weight

The complete list of xc_ide and XC-names can be found in: Libxc/src/xc_funcs.h  

	#define XC-name xc_ide  /*comments*/
