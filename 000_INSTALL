NOTE: More information on building might be available in the Gitlab wiki:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
   
To compile this version of Siesta you need at least the following libraries:

- xmlf90   (version 1.5.4 or higher)
- libPSML  (version 1.1.7 or higher)
- libGridXC (optionally with libxc), (version >= 0.8.5; 0.9.6 and above preferred),

which can be downloaded from https://gitlab.com/siesta-project/libraries, and

- OMM Bundle (libOMM, MatrixSwitch, pspblas) and DBCSR  (see README_OMM for details).

** For extra performance options, you should install the ELSI library,
with optional (recommended) external ELPA library. See README_ELSI.

** Support for the PSolver library from the BigDFT project is available. See the manual
   for intructions, and set WITH_PSOLVER=1 in the arch.make/fortran.mk files.

** Steps in detail

- Dowload, unpack, and compile the libraries (follow the instructions
  in the appropriate packages).

- Go back to the Siesta building directory and create an arch.make
  file following the instructions in Obj/README, reviewing the
  settings of the library installation paths, and type:

    (sh ../Src/obj_setup.sh if you have not yet done so)
    
    make


NOTE: The structure of the arch.make file has been improved, and user
      settings are now based on setting internal options
      (e.g. WITH_MPI=1, WITH_NETCDF=1) and providing the location of
      the needed libraries. Please read Obj/README.
