NOTE: More information on building might be available in the Gitlab wiki:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
   
To compile this version of Siesta you need at least the following libraries:

xmlf90
libPSML
libGridXC (optionally with libxc)

which can be downloaded from https://gitlab.com/siesta-project/libraries.

NOTE: You need version 1.5.4 of the xmlf90 library,
      at least version 0.8.5 of the libgridxc library (0.9.6 and above preferred) and
      at least version 1.1.7 of the libpsml library (libpsml-1.1.8 might be easier on some compilers).

** For extra performance options, you should install the ELSI library,
with optional (recommended) external ELPA library. See README_ELSI.

** Steps in detail

- Dowload and unpack the library tarballs

- Compile the xmlf90, libpsml, and libgridxc libraries (follow the
  instructions in the appropriate packages).

- Go back to the Siesta building directory and create an arch.make
  file following the instructions in Obj/README, reviewing the
  settings of the xmlf90, libpsml, and libgridxc import lines, and
  type

    (sh ../Src/obj_setup.sh if you have not yet done so)
    
    make


NOTE: The structure of the arch.make file has been improved, and user
      settings are now based on setting internal options
      (e.g. WITH_MPI=1, WITH_NETCDF=1) and providing the location of
      the needed libraries. Please read Obj/README.
