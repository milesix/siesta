SIESTA can be built:

* Using an experimental CMake framework (see file INSTALL.CMake for details,
quirks, and missing bits), including (new) Spack support.

* Using the traditional makefile-based approach, which has been
streamlined and made more user-friendly. It is still the most
complete (in the sense that it is able to install all the utilities),
but it can be slower.

  mkdir _build
  cd _build
  sh ../Config/obj_setup.sh           # *** Note changed directory

  (Now create arch.make in _build --- see Config/mk-build/README)

  make               (This will build the Siesta executable)
                     (It is best to do this first)
		     
  make utils         (See below for more options)
  make install       ( " )


In both cases, several external libraries must be installed before
Siesta can be compiled. This installation can be made on-the-fly,
using CMake, pkg-config, and git submodules:

- The xmlf90, libpsml, and libgridxc (required) libraries are available as
  submodules in the External subdirectory, set to the appropriate
  branches and/or tags for use in the current version of Siesta. If
  you want to use them, and you are using git, you need to do (just
  once, after you have fetched/cloned this Siesta branch):

     git submodule update --init --recursive <path>

  where <path> is the path to the submodule. Leave out '<path>' to
  enable all submodules.

- (If you plan to compile Siesta in a system without internet access
   (e.g. MareNostrum), you can use the 'stage_submodules.sh' script
   in the top level of the distribution to gather all the source files
   for later uploading)

- Make sure that your arch.make in the _build directory defines

       WITH_AUTOMATIC_REQ_LIBS=1

- Simply typing "make" will build the Siesta executable. CMake will
  configure and build the three libraries above, and the building
  scripts will arrange the right variables for library discovery in
  Siesta using pkg-config.
  The whole set of auxiliary programs can be built by "make utils".

- Installation: 'make install_siesta' or 'make install_utils'. The
  installation directory can be set in arch.make using the variable
  SIESTA_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY. Executable programs will be copied
  to the 'bin' subdirectory.

- Two auxiliary targets, "extlibs" and "create_install_directory" are
  called implicitly by the targets above. They can also be called
  directly to carry out the pre-compilation of the dependencies needed
  and to set up the installation directory, respectively. Once these
  two tasks are done, individual auxiliary programs can be built and
  installed independently by going to the relevant directory and
  typing "make" or "make install".

- You need a relatively recent version of CMake (>= 3.17)

The above steps involve a hybrid "makefile-CMake" approach. Very soon
it should be possible to use CMake for the installation of Siesta
itself, also with automatic installation of the required libraries.
