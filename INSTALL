(Interim file)

This is version of SIESTA with linear and cubic-scaling orbital minimization method (OMM)
implemented using omm-bundle and DBCSR libraries.

Installation notes
------------------

1. For linear-scaling methods, install dbcsr-2.1.0 version following instructions from
   https://cp2k.github.io/dbcsr/develop/page/2-user-guide/1-installation/index.html

2. Install omm-bundle from https://gitlab.com/irina_lebedeva/omm-bundle/-/tree/omm_sparse 
   following the installation instructions given in INSTALL.

3. Install this siesta version adding the following lines to arch.make:

OMMPATH = <path to omm-bundle installation directory>
MSPATH = $(OMMPATH)/build_MatrixSwitch
MSLIB = -L$(MSPATH)/lib -lMatrixSwitch
MSINC = -I$(MSPATH)/include

PSPPATH = $(OMMPATH)/build_pspBLAS
PSPLIB = -L$(PSPPATH)/lib -lpspBLAS
PSPINC = -I$(PSPPATH)/include

OMMLIBPATH = $(OMMPATH)/build_libOMM
OMMLIB = -L$(OMMLIBPATH)/lib -lOMM
OMMINC = -I$(OMMLIBPATH)/include

FFLAGS += -DHAVE_LIBOMM
LIBS += $(OMMLIB) $(MSLIB) $(PSPLIB)
INCFLAGS += $(OMMINC) $(MSINC) $(PSPINC)

# If DBCSR is used, add
DBCSR     = <path to dbcsr-2.1.0 installation directory>
DBCSRINC  = -I$(DBCSR)/install/include
DBCSRLIB  = -L$(DBCSR)/install/lib -ldbcsr

FFLAGS += -DHAVE_DBCSR
LIBS += $(DBCSRLIB)
INCFLAGS += $(DBCSRINC)

# If DBCSR and omm-bundle are installed with the OpenMP support, also add
LIBS += -qopenmp
FFLAGS += -qopenmp


Execution
---------

The input parameters for OMM methods with libOMM are described in README_OMM.

If the installation is with the OpenMP support, use only one thread. This can be done adding the following
lines to the submission script:

export OMP_PROC_BIND=true
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1

Examples of the input files can be found in Tests/h2o_blomm, Tests/h2o_libomm and Examples/OMM_methods.

=======
SIESTA can be built:

* Using an experimental CMake framework (see file INSTALL.CMake for details)

* Using the traditional makefile-based approach, which has been
streamlined and made more user-friendly.

  mkdir _build
  cd _build
  sh ../Config/obj_setup.sh           # *** Note changed directory

  (Now create arch.make in _build --- see Config/mk-build/README)

  make               (This will build the Siesta executable)
                     (It is best to do this first)
		     
  make utils         (See below for more options)
  make install       ( " )


In both cases, several external libraries must be installed before
Siesta can be compiled. Up to now, the user had to specify the
locations of the installed libraries in the arch.make file or in the
environment (e.g. XMLF90_ROOT=/path/to/xmlf90). While this approach
still works, and can be useful for its flexibility, a new scheme
facilitates the installation of the mandatory libraries
on-the-fly, using CMake, pkg-config, and git submodules:

- The xmlf90, libpsml, and libgridxc (required) libraries are available as
  submodules in the External subdirectory, set to the appropriate
  branches and/or tags for use in the current version of Siesta. If
  you want to use them, and you are using git, you need to do (just
  once, after you have fetched/cloned this Siesta branch):

     git submodule update --init --recursive <path>

  where <path> is the path to the submodule. Leave out '<path>' to
  enable all submodules.
  
  The libraries required to implement the optional DFT-D3 functionality
  are also available as submodules, and can be compiled with the same
  scheme as the mandatory libraries.

- (If you plan to compile Siesta in a system without internet access
   (e.g. MareNostrum), you can use the 'stage_submodules.sh' script
   in the top level of the distribution to gather all the source files
   for later uploading)

- Make sure that your arch.make in the _build directory defines

       WITH_AUTOMATIC_REQ_LIBS=1

- Simply typing "make" will build the Siesta executable. CMake will
  configure and build the libraries above, and the building
  scripts will arrange the right variables for library discovery in
  Siesta using pkg-config.
  The whole set of auxiliary programs can be built by "make utils".

- Installation: 'make install_siesta' or 'make install_utils'. The
  installation directory can be set in arch.make using the variable
  SIESTA_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY. Executable programs will be copied
  to the 'bin' subdirectory.

- Two auxiliary targets, "extlibs" and "create_install_directory" are
  called implicitly by the targets above. They can also be called
  directly to carry out the pre-compilation of the dependencies needed
  and to set up the installation directory, respectively. Once these
  two tasks are done, individual auxiliary programs can be built and
  installed independently by going to the relevant directory and
  typing "make" or "make install".

- You need a relatively recent version of CMake (>= 3.14)

The above steps involve a hybrid "makefile-CMake" approach. As
mentioned at the top, it is possible to use CMake for the installation
of Siesta itself, also with automatic installation of the required
libraries. The CMake framework is functional, but still needs some ironing out.
If you try it, please report problems and/or suggestions for improvement.
