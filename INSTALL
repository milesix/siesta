SIESTA can be built using an experimental CMake framework (see file INSTALL.CMake for details,
quirks, and missing bits).

The traditional makefile-based approach, which has been streamlined
and made more user-friendly, is still the recommended way:

mkdir _build
cd _build
sh ../Config/obj_setup.sh
(create arch.make --- see Config/mk-build/README)

make
make utils
make install
