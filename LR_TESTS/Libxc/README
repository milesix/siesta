This folder contains a single test for the linear-response features 
of Siesta using the Libxc library.

In order to run this test, the Siesta version that contains the
linear-response features has to be compiled using the Libxc 
library (check README_LINRES_LIBXC to install it).

- This test corresponds to a linear-response calculation of
  the hexagonal-boron-nitride unit cell displacing both atoms.
  This simple calculation allows us to show how the Libxc xc-potentials
  are called in a Siesta calculation.

- The pseudos needed for the calculation are inside the Pseudos folder.

The Refs/Libxc folder contains the output and the obtained FC file.
