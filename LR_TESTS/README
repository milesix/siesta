This folder contains all the associated test for the linear-response features of
 Siesta.

The structure of this folder is the following:

- 3 Tests are provided (2 bulk systems and a molecular one)
	- One of the tests is a single layer BN (2D material) 
          with a large Supercell enough to calculate the Phonon
          spectra in an easy way (read the README file in the BN test)

- The pseudos needed for each calculation are inside the Pseudos folder.

- The Refs folder contains two things for each Test:
        - The solution of the linear-response calculation
          (the Siesta output as well as the force constant
          matrix in the FC file are provided).
	- The same calculation but using the Frozen Phonon
          approach using Siesta (the output and the .FC file
          are provided)
