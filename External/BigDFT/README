(which uses git-subrepo to handle dependencies).

libyaml (repo yaml) is pinned at 0.1.6. It seems to work OK,
but YMMV.

NOTES on patches:

* Futile:  In the template for the .pc file, remove the mention of PYTHON_PATH,
  as it is typically left empty in our context and confuses pkg-config.

* Psolver: A 'mod' inside an 'if' statement led to a division by zero in some
  systems.
