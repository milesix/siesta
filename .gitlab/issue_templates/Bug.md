**Summary:**
<!--
Summarize the bug encountered concisely. Try to use also a
descriptive title for the issue.
-->


**Code version:**
<!--
Please indicate which Siesta version you used
(e.g., 4.1.5, or MaX-1.2.0-2-g598d19617).
This is vital since some bugs are already fixed in the development
branch.

If you only have access to the Siesta binary,
you can find the version string printed at the top of any Siesta output.

If you have access to the directories where Siesta was compiled,
this information can also be found in file `SIESTA-version`
(for recent versions of Siesta) or file `version.info`
(for older versions of Siesta; in this case,
if you obtained the source code using git,
please specify the precise Commit Id hash).
-->


**System information:**
<!--
Please provide:
- which operating system and version
- which compiler and version used
- which libraries and versions used
- the arch.make file.
- clarify whether the bug happens in serial or parallel runs

Ideally you should check this using two different compilers to ensure this
is not compiler/platform bugs.
-->


**Steps to reproduce:**
<!--
How to reproduce the problem, please be _very_ specific!

The smaller the test, the better!

Please provide all input files
- input fdf files
- pseudo-potential files
- for TranSiesta calculations also remember electrode information

Either attach here, use gist's or pastebin.
-->


**Expected behavior**
<!--
Describe what actually happens and what you see

Also describe what you would expect to happen.
-->


**Relevant logs and/or screenshots**
<!--
Attach any relevant logs (outputs).
Remeber to use (```) to create code-blocks for input etc.
For very large files, consider creating an issue GitLab project.
-->


**Possible fixes**
<!--
If you have any idea how to fix this, please do not hesitate to help us out!
Code links etc. are very welcome!
