This directory used to be the default Siesta build directory, that is, the default
place from where Siesta was compiled.

The build system has now been enhanced to allow the coexistence of multiple
compiled flavors of Siesta and the utility programs, and this directory has
lost its special status.

Please see the file INSTALL in the top level of the distribution for more
information about how to build Siesta.
