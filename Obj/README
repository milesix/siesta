This directory is the default place to hold the object files resulting
from the compilation of the sources in Src. 
The VPATH mechanism of modern 'make' programs is used. This scheme has
many advantages. Among them:

- The Src directory is kept pristine.
- Many different object directories can be used concurrently to
  compile the program with different compilers or optimization levels.
  (see below the NOTE for Advanced Users)

If you just want to compile the program, issue the command:

  sh ../Src/obj_setup.sh

to populate this directory with the minimal scaffolding of makefiles, and
then make sure that you create an 'arch.make' file. Then, type

  make

To compile utility programs (those living in Util), you can just simply
use the provided makefiles, typing "make" as appropriate.

### Creating arch.make files

It is suggested to start by taking a look at the ARCH-EXPERIMENTAL/README file.

Then, make a local copy of ARCH-EXPERIMENTAL/master-raw.make:

    cp ARCH-EXPERIMENTAL/master-raw.make arch.make

and then, either edit directly the options in the file, or just
uncomment the two lines starting at '#SELF_DIR' and create a small
'fortran.mk' include file with options. Examples of .mk files for
various architectures can be found also in the ARCH-EXPERIMENTAL
directory.


### NOTE for Advanced Users

The mechanism described here can be repeated in other directories at the same level,
with different names. Simply provide the appropriate arch.make, and issue the
setup command above. To compile utility programs, you need to use the form:

   make OBJDIR=ObjName

where ObjName is the name of the object directory of your choice.
