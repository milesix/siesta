This directory is the default place from where Siesta is compiled.  At the end
of the compilation, the directory will contain the siesta binary as well as the
the object files and any other by-products of the building process.

If you are interested in multiple concurrent compilations of Siesta (e.g., with
different compilers or optimization levels), see the section on Advanced
Compilation below.

=== Basic Compilation ===

If you just want to compile the program, follow the following steps:

1) From within this build directory (Obj), issue the command:

       $ sh ../Src/obj_setup.sh

   in order to populate it with with the minimal scaffolding of makefiles.

2) Ensure that an 'arch.make' file is present in the build directory.

   The Obj directory contains two default arch.make files:
     * gfortran.make for the serial compilation of Siesta using gfortran
     * intel.make for the serial compilation of Siesta using the Intel compiler
   You may rename one of these files to 'arch.make' or generate
   a file of your own.

3) Then, again from the build directory, execute

       $ make

To compile utility programs (those living in Util), you can simply
use the provided makefiles: go to the Util sub-directory containing
the relevant utility, and execute "make" as appropriate.

=== Advanced Compilation ===

It is possible to build Siesta from any build directory of your choice (instead
of Obj).  You will need to follow the same three steps as described above, the
main difference being that the first command will need to use a correct path
(absolute or relative) to the obj_setup.sh script, i.e., from your chosen build
directory you will need to execute

       $ sh <path/to/Src>/obj_setup.sh

Note also that your arch.make file needs to be in that chosen build directory
before you can execute make.

If Siesta is not compiled from the default Obj directory, when you compile your
utility programs you will need to specify the correct OBJDIR option:

       $ make OBJDIR=ObjName

where ObjName is the path to the Siesta build directory of your choice *relative*
to the Siesta top directory (the directory where you have Src, Obj, etc.).
E.g., if you already compiled Siesta from the build directory
Obj/intel/parallel/2021.2, and you want to compile Denchar, you need to

       $ cd Util/Denchar/Src
       $ make OBJDIR=Obj/intel/parallel/2021.2
