SIESTA-LINRES

Part of MaX-R3 release, June 2018
(For up-to-date versions, please visit http://launchpad.net/siesta/max-releases)

This is a special version of SIESTA able to carry out
density-functional perturbation theory (linear-response LINRES)
calculations. It is being developed in tandem with the main code, but
it still needs a special set of libraries and lacks a few features of
the main version, so it is released as an independent sub-package.

The LaTeX source for the manual (in siesta.tex) can be found in the
Docs/ directory. See the LINRES section for more information about the
specific features of this version.

Some examples of linear-response calculations can be found in the
LR_TESTS directory.

Please see the manual and the file README_LINRES_LIBXC for compilation
and other instructions.

For bug reports, and other code suggestions, please follow the guidelines
in the file Docs/REPORTING_BUGS
