This package, Siesta3L, contains an open-source implementation of the
SIESTA method to perform efficient electronic structure calculations
and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of molecules and solids,
as described in

The Siesta method for ab initio order-N materials simulation,
J. M. Soler, E. Artacho, J.D. Gale, A. Garcia, J. Junquera, P. Ordejon,
and D. Sanchez-Portal, 
J. Phys.: Condens. Matter, 14, 2745-2779 (2002),

and an open-source implementation of the TranSiesta method to model
open-boundary systems where ballistic electron transport is taking
place, as described in

Density-functional method for nonequilibrium electron transport,
M. Brandbyge, J.L. Mozos, P. Ordejon, J. Taylor, and K. Stokbro,
Phys. Rev. B 65, 165401 (2002).
