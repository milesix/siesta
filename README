This package, Siesta3L, contains an open-source implementation of the
SIESTA method to perform efficient electronic structure calculations
and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of molecules and solids,
as described in

The Siesta method for ab initio order-N materials simulation,
J. M. Soler, E. Artacho, J.D. Gale, A. Garcia, J. Junquera, P. Ordejon,
and D. Sanchez-Portal, 
J. Phys.: Condens. Matter, 14, 2745-2779 (2002),

and an open-source implementation of the TranSiesta method to model
open-boundary systems where ballistic electron transport is taking
place, as described in

Density-functional method for nonequilibrium electron transport,
M. Brandbyge, J.L. Mozos, P. Ordejon, J. Taylor, and K. Stokbro,
Phys. Rev. B 65, 165401 (2002).

Siesta3L is released as open source to provide the community with a
free reference implementation of the SIESTA method. It corresponds
essentially to the 3.2-pl5 version of the historic series. The SIESTA
project website at http://icmab.es/siesta contains pointers to
reference material, and to other implementations with updated
capabilities.
