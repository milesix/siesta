Release notes for Siesta-Linres (part of MaX-R3 release)

* The code currently implements DFPT for q=0 perturbations. It still
needs a proper supercell to carry out Force-constant-matrix
calculations. The advantage with respect to the 'Forces' mode of
operation in standard Siesta is that the derivatives used here are
formal, instead of through finite diferences.

* The code can use PSML pseudopotentials if they are first processed
by the standard Siesta version in this MaX release to generate the
.ion files which contain basis set and projector information. In full,
prepare a minimal fdf file with the appropriate chemical-species block
and basis-set specification, and include the fdf line:

atom-setup-only T

Run the standard version of Siesta, and then copy the .ion files to
the place where you intend to run a LinRes calculation. Then, in the
fdf file for the LinRes run, include the line

user-basis T


* Re-use of converged density matrices.

Siesta-Linres carries out an initial phase of convergence of the
electronic structure of the system, and then proceeds to the
linear-response cycle. The initial phase can be speeded up if a
(converged or nearly so) density-matrix from another Siesta run is
available. Note that the convergence thresholds used in
linear-response calculations might be more stringent than in normal
runs. See the documentation for the DM.UseSaveDM option in the manual.

* Limitations

Siesta-Linres does not yet work in non-collinear spin or spin-orbit
mode.
