Release notes for the Third Max Release of SIESTA

*** Use of PSML pseudopotentials

 * Please see the file README_PSML in the top directory for important
   information.

*** Backward-compatibility issues

 * The transiesta executable has been deprecated. Please use
      siesta --electrode 
   for electrode calculations. For regular transiesta runs, there
   is no need for the specific executable. 

*** New features

 - The TranSiesta and TBTrans performance has been significantly
   increased.
 
 - Added an interface to the ELSI library of electronic-structure
   solvers.
 
 - Added the CheSS solver as a new solution method. This is
   a linear scaling solver which calculates the density matrix and the
   energy density matrix.

 - Full spin-orbit-coupling through relativistic projectors
   
 - Added the Cold-smearing method for zero-temperature limit
   with smearing.

 - TDDFT implemented by R. Ullah via older code from
   D. Sanchez-Portal.

 - Use of the stand-alone libGridXC library
   (http://launchpad.net/libgridxc), including an interface to the libxc
   library.
 
 - Enabled custom k-points in PDOS and SCF calculations.

 - New 'Siesta-Linres' package for linear-response (Density Functional
   Perturbation Theory). (Released jointly with this one).
