Release notes for the MaX R2 release of Siesta

*** Backward-compatibility issues

 None.

*** New features

 - Added the updated LinRes module to compute the force-constant
   matrix by using Density-Functional Perturbation Theory.
  
 - Added the CheSS solver as a new solution method. This is
   a linear scaling solver which calculates the density matrix and the
   energy density matrix.

 - Added the Cold-smearing method as another option to enhance the convergence
   for metallic systems.

 - TDDFT implemented by R. Ullah via older code from
   D. Sanchez-Portal.
   
 - Refactoring of the diagonalization subsystem: more choice of
   methods and performance and memory-use improvements.

 - Enhanced control of quantum engine operations through an
   embedded Lua interpreter
