November 29, 2015  Alberto Garcia                 trunk-479--genq-2
Create files with generalized-coordinate information. Docs.

The file GENQ.latest contains the latest values of the
gen. coords. for which the electronic-structure has been
computed. File GENQ.next contains the latest predicted values for the
generalized coordinates. Note that both files will be identical if the
calculation ends normally. If not, GENQ.next might be used to restart
the calculation.

Add some documentation on the generalized-coordinates feature to the manual, and
made Src/obj_setup.sh more portable (avoiding the '-n' option to 'cp').

Sync to trunk-479. Handle geom.inc.template

Sync to trunk-479.

Additionally, use a new mechanism for automatic compilation without
the need to create a 'geom.inc' file. A 'geom.inc.template' file in
Src is copied to the compilation directory as 'geom.inc' by the setup
script. The file is compilable, but it contains a statement that will
stop the program if generalized coordinates are used.

Summary and documentation of recent changes

* A more flexible setup for compilation.

For each geometry to be studied, the user can prepare a "geom.inc"
file which contains the fortran code to generate the atomic
coordinates from the generalized coordinates. This file will be
included automatically by the compiler at the time of compilation of
Src/m_genq.f90.  It should be placed in the appropriate building
directory, instead of Src. In that way, multiple geometries can be
compiled from the same source. See examples of 'geom' files in
Tests/h2o-genq and Tests/h2o-genq-fixang.

* The tolerance for the generalized forces is now estimated using a
more robust (but not completely foolproof) algorithm. For a given
geometry, the tolerance for Force "i" is computed as the absolute
value of the generalized force corresponding to cartesian atomic
forces of size "ftol" and the same sign as the actual forces ("ftol"
is the standard cartesian force tolerance). That is, it is assumed
that the (possibly large) forces at this point will eventually be
small enough to be at or below "ftol", but pointing basically in the
same direction. This is an approximation, and the generalized
tolerance computed in this way will vary as the relaxation
progresses. Typically its magnitude will not change too much, except
in pathological cases. Possible extensions to this idea include
choosing an average of the tolerances (maybe avoiding configurations
close to the minimum).

* The fdf tolerance-setting options and their defaults are now:

MD.Genq.UseCartForceTol   F

If true, we request that the forces on *all* atoms are below
ftol. This is not desirable in cases in which we are dealing with an
artificially constrained geometry. See for example the h2o-genq-fixang
test.

MD.Genq.UseGenqChangeTol  F

If true, monitor the change in the value of the generalized
coordinates, and stop if it is below

MD.Genq.Tolerance    1.e-4

* A number of heuristics which are really only appropriate (if at all)
to crystallographic applications are still used in the code. For example,
the estimation of the maximum allowed change in the generalized coordinates
in a relaxation step, or the size of the initial inverse Jacobian.
A possibility is to generalize the format of the GENQ file and allow that
information to be entered by the user.

(**NOTE** Re-branching of genq)

June 4, 2012  Alberto Garcia                    3.1-pl9-genq-3
Some more bug fixes and new hooks for parameters.

Some of the relaxation parameters are estimated by the program, and
can be fine-tuned in the fdf file:

For example, 

MD.Broyden.Genq.Initial.Inverse.Jacobian 0.005

will set by hand the value of J^(-1).

The generalized-force tolerance is estimated by the program as
ftol times the largest cell vector component.

A new convergence option is based on a tolerance for change in 
the generalized coordinates. It is 0.0001 by default, and can be
set by

MD.Genq.Tolerance  <value>
