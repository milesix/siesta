*******************************************************************

The SIESTA project was initiated by P. Ordejon (then at the Univ. de
Oviedo), and J.M. Soler and E. Artacho (Univ. Autonoma de Madrid,
UAM).  The development team was then joined by A. Garcia (then at
Univ. del Pais Vasco, Bilbao), D. Sanchez-Portal (UAM), and
J. Junquera (Univ. de Oviedo and later UAM), and sometime later by
J. Gale (then at Imperial College, London). In 2007 J.M. Cela
(Barcelona Supercomputing Center, BSC) became a developer.

The TranSiesta module within Siesta-3L was originally developed by
P. Ordejon and J.L. Mozos (then at ICMAB-CSIC), and M. Brandbyge,
K. Stokbro, and J. Taylor (Technical Univ. of Denmark).

O.F. Sankey, D.J. Niklewski and D.A. Drabold made the FIREBALL code
available to P. Ordejon.  Although we no longer use the routines in
that code, it was essential in the initial development of Siesta-3L,
which still uses many of the algorithms developed by them.
