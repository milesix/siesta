Generalized-coordinates specification.

Originally, the mechanism used was based on a fortran source snippet that was compiled in. These are
the .geom examples here.

More recently, Lua files that can be processed at run time, without the need of recompilation, are used.
As an example, the TiSe geom file has been converted to 'genq-tise.lua'.  Conversion of the other files
is left as an exercise to the reader.
