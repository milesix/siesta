New heuristics options for neighbor ordering in hsparse

Implemented two new heuristics for neighbor ordering in hsparse,
one based on distance, and the other on a random shuffling. The aim
of the second is to test the restructuring of the DM upon geometry
changes, and also to test hsparse itself internally.
