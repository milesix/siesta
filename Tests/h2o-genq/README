Water molecule with generalized coordinates:

doh: O-H distance
alpha: H-O-H angle in radians

File genq-flook.lua contains the code to generate the fractional coordinates
from the generalizeed coordinates. Note that since it is a molecule,
doh is 1/L times smaller than the real D(OH), where L is the lattice constant
of the box (in this case 10 Ang).

To run this example, you need the pseudopotentials
(get the pseudos)
