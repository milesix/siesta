Water molecule with generalized coordinates:

doh: O-H distance
alpha: H-O-H angle in radians

File h2o.geom contains the code to generate the fractional coordinates
from the generalizeed coordinates. Note that since it is a molecule,
doh is 1/L times smaller than the real D(OH), where L is the lattice constant
of the box (in this case 10 Ang).

File h2o.geom should be linked to geom.inc in the build directory, to be
included from m_genq.f90:

mkdir Obj-h2o
cd Obj-h2o

(create arch.make ...)

ln -sf h2o.geom geom.inc
sh ../Src/obj_setup.sh
make
cd h2o-genq
(get the pseudos)
../../siesta < h2o-genq.fdf | tee OUT
