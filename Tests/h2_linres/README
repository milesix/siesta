This test exercises the linear-response features
of Siesta.

By default, a "make" command will run Siesta with h2.fdf as input,
computing the force-constant matrix for the system.

The unit cell is composed of just two atoms, but a supercell is
defined to properly account for the forces on the rest of the atoms
when any of the unit-cell atoms move. The real-space force-constant
information can be converted into a reciprocal-space dynamical matrix,
which gives the relevant phonon frequencies when diagonalized. This is
analogous to the handling of the electronic hamiltonian: the
real-space matrix elements between the unit-cell orbitals and the
supercell ones are converted into reciprocal-space matrix elements and
diagonalized to get the electronic band structure.

The force-constant matrix is contained by default in the
(label)/h2.FC file, where (label) is 'work' by default. In order to
compute the molecular vibrational frequencies, the 'vibra'
program must be executed..
