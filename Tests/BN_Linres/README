This test exercises the linear-response features
of Siesta.

By default, a "make" command will run Siesta with BNlin.fdf as input,
computing the force-constant matrix for the system.

The unit cell is composed of just two atoms, but a supercell is
defined to properly account for the forces on the rest of the atoms
when any of the unit-cell atoms move. The real-space force-constant
information can be converted into a reciprocal-space dynamical matrix,
which gives the relevant phonon frequencies when diagonalized. This is
analogous to the handling of the electronic hamiltonian: the
real-space matrix elements between the unit-cell orbitals and the
supercell ones are converted into reciprocal-space matrix elements and
diagonalized to get the electronic band structure.

The force-constant matrix is contained in the (label)/BNlin.LRFC file,
where (label) is 'work' by default. In order to construct the
dynamical matrix and compute the phonons, the 'vibra' program must be
executed with BN.fdf as input.

(Before proceeding, see Util/Vibra/Docs for documentation, and compile
Util/Vibra/Src/vibra. Also, compile Util/Bands/gnubands to process the
phonon dispersion plot.)

Now the sequence of steps would be:

       cd work
       /path/to/vibra < ../BN.fdf
               (a BN.bands file will be produced)
       /path/to/gnubands -G -o BNphonons.dat BN.bands
       gnuplot -persist BNphonons.gplot

The '-G' option to gnubands requests the production of a .gplot file
with the proper commands for gnuplot, in addition to the data file.
