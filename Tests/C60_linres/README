This test exercises the linear-response features of Siesta.

By default, a "make" command will run Siesta with C60.fdf as input,
computing the force-constant matrix for the system.

The unit cell is composed of 60C atoms, a supercell is
defined to properly accovoid interaction between unit cell replicas. 
The real-space force-constant information can be converted into
a reciprocal-space dynamical matrix, which gives the relevant
phonon frequencies when diagonalized. 

The force-constant matrix is contained by default in the
(label)/C60.FC file, where (label) is 'work' by default. In order to
compute the molecular vibrational frequencies, the 'vibra'
program must be executed..

(Before proceeding, see Util/Vibra/Docs for documentation, and compile
Util/Vibra/Src/vibra.
