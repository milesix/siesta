This test exercises the linear-response features of Siesta.

By default, a "make" command will run Siesta with C60.fdf as input,
computing the force-constant matrix for the system.

This corresponds to the calculation of the vibrational frequencies 
of the C60 molecule.

The force-constant matrix is contained by default in the
(label)/c60linres.FC file, where (label) is 'work' by default. In order to
compute the molecular vibrational frequencies, the 'vibra'
program must be executed..

(Before proceeding, see Util/Vibra/Docs for documentation, and compile
Util/Vibra/Src/vibra.
