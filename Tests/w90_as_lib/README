(* This is a simpler version of the w90_in_siesta test,
   with fewer k-points and lower cutoffs *)
   
In this example we will generate the Wannier functions of three
different manifolds in SIESTA.

The first one includes the top of the valence bands
The second one the bottom of the conduction bands
The third one, the two previous set of bands considered together

Wannier90 will be called directly from SIESTA, 
without the need to prepare a special input file for Wannier90
