Water molecule with one free generalized coordinate:

doh: O-H distance

and a second fixed coordinate:

alpha: H-O-H angle in radians. Here fixed to 2 radians (which is larger than
the equilibrium one, approx 1.83).

File h2o-fixang.geom contains the code to generate the fractional coordinates
from the generalizeed coordinates. Note that since it is a molecule,
doh is 1/L times smaller than the real D(OH), where L is the lattice constant
of the box (in this case 10 Ang).

File h2o-fixang.geom should be linked to geom.inc in the build directory, to be
included from m_genq.f90:

mkdir Obj-h2o-fixang
cd Obj-h2o-fixang

(create arch.make ...)

ln -sf h2o-fixang.geom geom.inc
sh ../Src/obj_setup.sh
make
cd h2o-genq-fixang
(get the pseudos)
../../siesta < h2o-genq-fixang.fdf | tee OUT  

There should be residual forces on the atoms, as the final geometry is the "best"
given the fixed angle, but not an absolute minimum of the energy.
